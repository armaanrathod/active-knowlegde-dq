# active-knowlegde-dq

Our project turns any article into a live debate! Our webpage extracts key points, creates two AI personas arguing for and against the ideas, and lets the user join in. It makes reading active by letting you interact, challenge, and think critically about the content. Making the boring task of learning an active process.

## New Debate System Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced Debate Flow
- **5-Point System**: Each round generates exactly 5 points FOR and 5 points AGAINST the topic
- **User Interaction**: Three questions are presented to the user after each round
- **Intelligent Continuation**: If user answers "Yes", the debate continues with 5 additional points
- **Relevance Tracking**: System monitors argument relevance to the original article
- **Automatic Termination**: Debate gracefully ends when relevance drops below 40%

### ðŸ”„ How It Works
1. **Article Input**: User provides article text or uploads PDF
2. **Initial Debate**: System generates 5 FOR + 5 AGAINST points
3. **User Questions**: Three engagement questions are asked:
   - "Are you finding new insights from this debate?"
   - "Do you want to explore more arguments on this topic?"
   - "Should the debate continue with additional points?"
4. **Continuation Loop**: If user says "Yes", generate 5 more points and repeat
5. **Intelligent Exit**: When relevance drops to 40%, system provides graceful conclusion

### ðŸ›  Technical Implementation
- **Backend**: Flask API with debate state management
- **Frontend**: Enhanced HTML interface with user interaction controls
- **Relevance Algorithm**: Keyword-based relevance calculation
- **Session Management**: Tracks debate history, rounds, and relevance metrics
