# active-knowlegde-dq

**active-knowlegde-dq** turns any article into a live debate!  
Our webpage extracts key points, creates two AI personas arguing for and against the ideas, and lets the user join in. It makes reading active by letting you interact, challenge, and think critically about the content. Learning becomes an *active* processâ€”not a boring task.

## Features
- Extracts and summarizes key points from any article
- Generates two AI personas to debate the content (pro & con)
- Lets users jump into the debate, respond, or challenge either side
- Encourages active reading and critical thinking

## Status
The core system is functional and independent. We are currently refining and integrating the frontend and backend for a seamless user experience.
